Defining the modified Fibonacci sequence as:

F(n) = F(n-1) + 2F(n-2) + 3F(n-3)
where, F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(2) = 3

The following tasks have to complete for an entire score:

1. Write a function to return the nth modified Fibonacci number in less than O(n) time.
2. Write a function to print the first n modified Fibonacci numbers in O(n) time.
3. Clearly explain your solution, with proofs for how you arrived at the time complexities.
